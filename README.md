# MHD
MHD airport for FSE/Xplane

The XAYMHY pack effectively "removes" the XAYMHY scenery pack due to its funny name.

The MHD pack becomes the real scenery folder with the FSE name of MHD.

Not that this technically makes it unsuitable for the gateway as MHD is the FSE name, not the real life name.
